# qDHT: Quantum-Resistant Distributed Hash Table for Mobile Devices

## Overview

qDHT aims to create a lightweight, anonymous, and quantum-resistant Distributed Hash Table (DHT) suitable for mobile devices, with eventual expansion into custom hardware and chipsets. This DHT will support private peer-to-peer communication and the distributed training of pre-trained AI models, accessible from master nodes. The design prioritizes efficiency, privacy, and post-quantum cryptographic resilience.

## Design Goals

1. **Lightweight Operation**: Optimize for mobile devices with limited resources.
2. **Anonymity and Privacy**: Ensure user and data anonymity through cryptographic techniques.
3. **Quantum Resistance**: Utilize post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to safeguard against quantum computing threats.
4. **Scalability**: Design to efficiently handle growth in network size and data volume.
5. **AI Model Training and Sharing**: Support distributed learning and sharing of AI models.

## System Components

### Mobile-Compatible DHT

- **Structure**: Optimized DHT algorithm for efficient lookup, storage, and retrieval with minimal overhead.
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Integration of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for secure node communication and data storage.
- **Anonymization Layer**: Utilizes cryptographic commitments and optional zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to anonymize node interactions.

### Private Peer-to-Peer Communication Protocol

- **Encrypted Messaging**: Implement lightweight encryption for messaging, leveraging quantum-resistant algorithms.
- **Direct and Group Communication**: Support for both one-to-one and group messaging within the DHT network.
- **Anonymity Guarantees**: Ensure the protocol hides metadata, including sender, receiver, and message content.

### Distributed AI Model Training

- **Model Sharing**: Mechanism for distributing and accessing pre-trained AI models across the network.
- **Incremental Training**: Support for incremental model updates using data from mobile devices, reducing computational requirements.
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Apply federated learning and differential privacy to safeguard user data during model training.
