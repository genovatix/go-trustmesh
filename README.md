# TrustMesh: Next-Gen Future-Proof Decentralized Network

Welcome to the TrustMesh GitHub Wiki, your comprehensive guide to navigating and contributing to the TrustMesh project. TrustMesh aims to be the backbone of a next-generation, future-proof decentralized network, serving as a parallel internet designed for privacy, security, and scalability, resistant to the emerging threats posed by quantum computing.

## Overview

TrustMesh is an ambitious project designed to redefine how we think about digital communication and data exchange. Leveraging cutting-edge post-quantum cryptography, TrustMesh provides a secure, anonymous, and efficient framework for building decentralized applications (DApps), facilitating peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, and supporting distributed computing and AI model training across a global network of mobile and custom hardware devices.

### Key Objectives

- **Decentralization**: Creating a robust network that operates independently of centralized control, enhancing privacy and resistance to censorship.
- **Quantum Resistance**: Incorporating cryptographic algorithms that remain secure against quantum computer attacks, ensuring long-term data protection.
- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Designing a network that scales seamlessly with demand without compromising speed or functionality, optimized for mobile and custom hardware.
- **Innovation in AI and Distributed Computing**: Enabling collaborative, privacy-preserving advancements in artificial intelligence and distributed computing technologies.
